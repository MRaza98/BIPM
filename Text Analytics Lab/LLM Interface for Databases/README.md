# Project Description

## LLM Interface for Databases Problem
- Large Language Models (LLM) suffer from the phenomenon of hallucination.
- This can lead to incorrect answers and misinformation.
- One way of preventing this is to use a form of fine-tuning: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
- In this project, we want to experiment with a different approach using data from a relational database to improve the results of LLMs.
## Generation which is based on a vector database
- In this project, we want to experiment with a different approach using data from a relational database to improve the results of LLMs.
## Research Question
- How can we use a SQL database to generate prompts that improve the accuracy of large language models?
## Initial Ideas
- Create a system that generates SQL queries based on user input, e.g., "Give me an overview about the use of sentiment mining for marketing analytics in the last 5 years (in the top IS-journals)".
- Create prompts with additional information from SQL queries. Try different prompting strategies to improve results. Try to incorporate the use of entities from the IS Ontology.
- Develop and evaluate different use cases, e.g., comparison/clustering of results retrieved from a sql query.
