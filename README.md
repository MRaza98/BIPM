# BIPM

This repo contains all the code from the BIPM Course.

## How did I get set up with Jupyter and Python within VSCode?

1. Install Python and Jupyter Extensions
2. Create .ipynb file

## Data Science Guideline

1. General information:
   1. Name of the used dataset
   2. List of all participating students (group has max. 3 students)
2. Business Understanding
   1. Short description of the business problem that you want to solve (it is ok to use your own assumptions)
3. Data Understanding (Exploratory Data Analysis)
   1. Description of the data set
   2. Data visualization
   3. Analysis of missing data
4. Data Preparation
   1. How and why did you select the features?
   2. Did you derive new features?
   3. How did you deal with missing data?
   4. How and why did you transform the data?
   5. How did you split the data?
     A split into test and training data is required.
     A cross-evaluation or validation set can also be used to optimize the parameters (train, validation, test set).
5. Model Building
   1. Which machine learning models did you use and why?
   2. How did you adjust the parameters of your machine learning model and why?
   3. What are the resulting machine learning models?
   4. A plus is if you build more than one machine learning model
   5. You should add an understandable description of the types of machine learning models you used
6. Model Evaluation
   1. Evaluation of the selected models: How will your models perform in practice?
   2. Did you compare different models? If yes, which one is better? For what metric?
   3. If you have a classification task, try to find a model and parameters with high accuracy in the test set. Are both errors (false positive and false negative) equally important? How could you adjust for different costs of the errors?
   4. Try to find a model and parameters with a high accuracy in the test set.
   5. Description of the approach chosen to optimize the parameters
   6. Discuss evaluation results (e.g., are false positive and false negative errors equally important? How could you balance the different costs of the errors)?
7. Possible Business Use
   1. How would your model help the business? How is it solving the business problem?
   2. What is the meaning of your model and your solution from a business perspective?
