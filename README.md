# BIPM

This repo contains all the code from the BIPM Course.

## How did I get set up with Jupyter and Python within VSCode?

1. Install Python and Jupyter Extensions
2. Create .ipynb file

## Data Science Guideline

1. General information:
  § Name of the used dataset
  § List of all participating students (group has max. 3 students)
2. Business Understanding
§ Short description of the business problem that you want to solve (it is ok to use
your own assumptions)
3. Data Understanding (Exploratory Data Analysis)
§ Description of the data set
§ Data visualization
§ Analysis of missing data
4. Data Preparation
§ How and why did your select the features?
§ Did you derive new features?
§ How did you deal with missing data?
§ How and why did you transform the data?
§ How did you split the data?
• A split into test and training data is required.
• A cross-evaluation or validation set can also be used to optimize the
parameters (train, validation, test set).
5. Model Building
§ Which machine learning models did you use and why?
§ How did you adjust the parameters of your machine learning model and why?
§ What are the resulting machine learning models?
§ A plus is if you build more than one machine learning model
